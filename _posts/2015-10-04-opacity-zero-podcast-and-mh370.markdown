If you are interested in the subject of aviation and the MH370 accident I recently discovered the [Opacity Zero Podcast](http://opacityzero.press/category/podcast/) which has a number of episodes that cover aspects of that event.
Previously I had become familiar with the Air France 447 accident so MH370 also interests me.
In the AF447 case the accident was eventually attributable to pilot error but in MH370 nothing has been determined yet as an actual cause.
Finding the flight recorders will likely be the only way to be certain of exactly what transpired.

One fact that I had not known regarding MH370 was that Vietnamese military air defense radar had continued to track the aircraft for a period of time after contact and radar information was lost by air traffic control.

I do recommend the Opacity Zero podcast because it is well done and contains numerous details that I was not aware of.
