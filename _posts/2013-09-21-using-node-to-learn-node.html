I've been working on improving my NodeJS knowledge and ran across an interesting way to do that today.  This is an application that teaches you some Node by giving you a set of lessons to write and learn from.  It evaluates the output of each lesson to determine whether or not you did the exercise correctly  I generally do not install globally so if you do not install it globally you can still verify your output by using a relative path to the verify script like this 'node ../learnyounode.js  verify myprogram.js'.  <a href="https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode">https://github.com/rvagg/learnyounode</a>
