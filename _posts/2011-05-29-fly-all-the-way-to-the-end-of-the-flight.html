Had another instrument lesson (RedBird FMX full motion simulator)  the other night right after work again.  I did reasonably well right up until the end.  the approach went reasonably well but I landed a little flat and a little fast.  I inadvertently pitched up and then porpoised right back down and nosed over on the runway.  Luckily was in the sim but I a pretty sure that part of the problem is transitioning from work think to pilot think.  I need to spend at least a few minutes getting into the correct mental state before flying.  The main lesson was that you don't stop flying until the airplane actually stops.
