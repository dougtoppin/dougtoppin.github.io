I recently installed the OS X Yosemite beta on my MacBook Pro and it has worked well except for one issue so far.
I use JBoss Developer Studio (Eclipse) for my work on JBoss EAP (in Fuse Service Works). With Yosemite I discovered that the chooser scroll bar causes JBDS to abort every time when I try to switch workspaces or import a project.
The workaround is to use the up/down arow keys which has worked for me so far.
Other than that I have not had any issues but am trying various activities on it and will mention any other pros/cons that I discover.
