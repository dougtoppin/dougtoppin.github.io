The more time that I spend working with Node the more impressed that I get with it.  The main thing that I'm missing is using an IDE with it for improved code completion.  So far I've been using vim (my old habit) and I think that I'm spending too much time making typos.  I've been trying a little screen scraping with YQL but that is tougher than I had expected.  As a side project I need to come up with some data analysis so I started trying out Python to see if it would do what I need.  I've used it in the past for basic scripting but but now that I have a practical need I'm appreciating it as well.  I'm interested in combining the two for this project and hoping that it turns out to be a good decision.
