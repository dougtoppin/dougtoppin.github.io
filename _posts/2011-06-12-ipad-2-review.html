I have had a iPad-1 for a number of months and have been completely satisfied with it.  Once the iPad-2 came out I have been debating whether or not to get one.  The potential of the camera was attractive enough to keep me thinking about it but I kept delaying the decision.  A recent conversation with a friend from graduate school who had made the upgrade finally convinced me to "just do it".  I am satisfied with it but have not gotten the hang of the smart case yet.  I had a much larger case on the iPad-1 which I could quickly set up in the couple of configurations that it supported.  The smart case has given me a much harder time to get into an orientation that I is comfortable.  I am probably going to keep an eye out for a better choice.  As to the device itself, the performance is definitely a bit better and the camera is convenient.  The other features of AirPlay video to Apple TV is also helpful.  That had been an issue a couple of times previously.   So far I am 50/50 on the benefit of upgrading.<br />
