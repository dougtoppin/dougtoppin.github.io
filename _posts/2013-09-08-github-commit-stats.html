Github continues to provide a variety of services and capabilities and I looked more closely at one today.  I was looking at the Linnovate MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) project at https://github.com/Xorcode/mean and decided to look at the graphs link at https://github.com/Xorcode/mean/graphs.  Github makes granular commit data available and a few different ways to view it.  The Contributors, Code Frequency, Commit Activity and Punchcard sections are all interesting to look at. If someone is looking for a package/module to make use of it is probably worthwhile to evaluate the level of community interest by seeing how many people are adding to it and how frequently.  Given the volume of open source software and the potential for many similar packages it can be difficult to decide which direction to go in.  Another interesting aspect of this data is the opportunity to evaluate potential job candidates by the ability to look very closely at their participation in related areas of your business.
This may not always be a fair evaluation of candidates because of limitations in their opportunities to contribute or participate at all but can certainly provide a leg up for some.
