Something that I have observed for a while is that software technologies are evolving so rapidly that it can become difficult to find example code or tutorials on the Internet that match what you might be using.  This is particularly true in the case of iOS and Xcode where many of the tutorials that I find predate the current Xcode 4.3.2 and, as a result, the instructions and screenshots are difficult to match up to what I see when I try to follow the tutorial.  It shows that it behooves people that take the time and effort to compose tutorials to clearly indicate the version of the development environment that was used and as well come up with a scheme where they can update the tutorial as versions change and still keep all prior versions available for reference.  Doing this would provide the most value to their site and continue to draw more viewers to it.
