I like Fortune magazine but I dislike throwing it away and therefore end up with stacks of old magazines that I haven't gotten to.  The magazine publishing industry should be aggressively moving to tablet (iPad in my case) or at least online only subscription models.  I am willing to pay the same price for an iPad edition as a print edition and not get the print version.   This would save costs on the publishers part as well as reduce the clutter in my house.  The Economist is an example of this and I am entirely satisfied with their iPad edition which also happens to include the audio for the magazine.  I have immediate access to the current and previous editions which fits my preferred model perfectly.
