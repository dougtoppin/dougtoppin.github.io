I have noticed an interesting habit that I used to have that has stopped maybe due to using my iPad for approach plates, weather and so on.  Before I started using it I always had printed AFDs and sectionals.  I would regularly just flip through them and look at different airports and areas and then would also look at the legend for symbols that I did not recognize just to learn a little more.  Now that I am using the iPad I notice that I don't browse as much as I used to.  Instead, I tend to use it for specific pieces of information.  Printed material lends itself a little better to just flipping through it I think.  Anyone have any opinions or experiences on that?
