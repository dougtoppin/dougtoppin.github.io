If you are into defense I recommend a recent ArmsControlWonk podcast.
It is on the end of Russia's last early warning satellite.
There are numerous implications of and benefits to early warning (of ballistic missile launch specifically) for everyone because it gives your command authority more time to decide if they need to retaliate.
I learned a number of things from this one about past events during the cold war as well.
How much trust do you have in missile launch officers of every nation that has a ballistic missile capability?
Would they launch if all of the instruments/sensors/command told them to?
