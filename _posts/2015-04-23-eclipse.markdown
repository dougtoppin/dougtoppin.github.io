I'm doing a little Go work and am using the Goclipse plugin for Eclipse.
In setting it up I kept getting the error `no gocode path provided` an my autocomplete was not working.
I just stumbled on what was wrong and wanted to pass it along in case anyone runs into it.
`gocode` provides autocomplete for your go work in Eclipse/Goclipse.

You need to install `gocode` [https://github.com/nsf/gocode](https://github.com/nsf/gocode) first.
Then in the eclipse preferences look for `go` -> `tools` and browse and set the `gocode path`.
At that point autocomplete for your `go` projects should start working (and that error should stop happening).
