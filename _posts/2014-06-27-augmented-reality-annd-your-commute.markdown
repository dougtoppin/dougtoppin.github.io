Someday soon augmented reality will come to fruition and we will have it available on our car windshields/dashboards and/or glasses that we wear. One app that I would really like to write for that eventuality is for vehicle recognition where vehicles that you regularly see on your commute that also regularly exhibit odd or poor driving behavior are high lighted in your field of view. I often see a red pickup on my drive that will regularly "mess up" the merge/exit lanes at 28 and the toll road by driving too slowly or changing lanes unexpectedly (like today).
I'm sure that there are a number of other ones that I encounter on my drive and I would like to get a heads up that they are ahead of me. After that an integration with the Waze app would be nice where it would observe them and route me around them.
