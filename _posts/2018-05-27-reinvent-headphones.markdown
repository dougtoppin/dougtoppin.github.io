A tip on aws #reInvent this year is to bring noise canceling headphones.
If a session is full there may be noise in the overflow areas making it very difficult to hear an audio stream even though you can see the video monitors.

In 2017 the Aria session overflow area was next to some exhibits and the noise level was high enough that listening to sessions being broadcast was very difficult.
Luckily I had my QC35s back in my room so once I went back and got them it was a bit better.
