I'm still experimenting with using Github pages for my blog and wanted to add my most recent tweets.  I ran across this http://blog.jmac.org/blog/2013/03/30/putting-twitter-back-into-octopress/ which was perfect for describing how to create a twitter widget (html/js which references a twitter stream) and how to add it to this.  Hopefully, you can see the result on the right side of the page.  If not, just one more thing on my todo list.
