Up to now I have been satisfied with the Apple TV we bought a few weeks ago.  However, we rented the movie "Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer" this evening ($8.) and have been completely disappointed with the streaming experience of it. It has been pausing for long periods (in excess of 10-minutes each) which has made the movie almost unwatchable.  Up until a recent software update of it I have had no complaints at all.  I recommend the movie but as of right now I do not recommend the Apple TV rental experience.
