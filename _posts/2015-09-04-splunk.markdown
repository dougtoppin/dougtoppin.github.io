Just a little follow up on the post I made a couple of days ago about using Splunk on the AWS.
I noticed today that they also have iOS and Android apps and a mobile access server to support them.
I installed the mobile access server on my ec2 instance, connected it to the Splunk server and then installed the iOS app on my iPad.
I'm using it now to browse the examples and weather dashboard that I set up.
Works like a champ.

I also installed their example dashboards which you can use to see neat ways to visualize and how to create them.
Nicely done.
