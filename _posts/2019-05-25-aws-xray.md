description: AWS X-Ray for instrumentation metrics
keywords: aws x-ray xray
---
I started using the AWS X-Ray service 3 weeks ago and wanted to pass along my experiences.
The service collects and reports data about your applications.
That data can include the time required to execute sections of your code.
This can provide both the absolute time required and comparison of changes between different
software releases or external interface behavior changes.

In 2 cases so far the trace data immediately helped me identify the location, down to the function level,
of where a slowdown was occurring in request processing of a Python Flask application running in an AWS Fargate cluster.
The value of trace and metric data cannot be underestimated when it is needed.
Without that data the labor and time cost of problem isolation and understanding is significantly
greater than the effort in adding the instrumentation.

The code changes involved a couple of imports and maybe 10 lines total to start getting
a starting point in traces.
Each area of code that metric data is desired only requires 2 or 3 lines of code surrounding each area.

To control cost it is possible to include a sampling rate control where metrics on every execution
are not collected.
