I am finding it interesting that I am beginning to spend more time using apps on my iPad/iPhone for specific functions like news, email, photo editing, photo taking and uploading to my parent's Ceiva frame, credit card account payments, sketching and note taking.  I tend to use a desktop browser for searching probably because of screen real estate.
I think that it is an indication that apps for targeted functions will continue to grow and that it behooves companies to expand in this area.  Building corporate skills and experience in developing and managing this environment is different from that of web sites and the sooner that you learn the better.<br />
