I gave a little introduction to Node.js presentation at the NOVALUG meeting this weekend.  NOVALUG is a local Linux user group that has been in existence for 20 years this month and is an excellent group of people.  I have been a member of the NOVALUG for around 18 years.
Node is an interesting subject and the presentation was received well with a lot of related and peripheral discussion during the meeting.
