A couple of months ago I bought a DJI Mavic Pro drone.
In a single word is it amazing.
The technology in it is excellent.

Today I received the DJI Goggles which is a headset with a display that gives you the camera view from the drone.

 I just got around to doing the actual setup on the goggles.
 The total weight is 2.4 lbs with the weight being in the headband where the electronics and battery are.
 The headband is adjustable in the back to tighten/loosen it up.
 Once it is on and the display portion is lowered over your eyes you do not feel the weight at all.
 That might change once I've been wearing them for a while.
 There is a touchpad on the side of the display with numerous functions.
 I went through the tutorial and retained pretty much nothing.
 Once the setup and linking with the drone were complete you immediately get the drone camera view in the display.
 At that point both the phone app camera view and goggles camera views were active.
 Both the controller/phone and headset are linked to the goggles.
 There are a boatload of functions associated with the headset and it will take a lot of practice to get any familiarity with it.
 
 DJI recommends having a second person use the goggles while someone else pilots the drone with the controller for safety (and I can see why).
 This is not a toy but it looks like it going to be a ton of fun.
 
 It is hard to believe how much technology is sitting in your hands between the drone, the controller/phone and the goggles.
