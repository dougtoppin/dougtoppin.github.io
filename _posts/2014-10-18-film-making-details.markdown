If you are interested in film making I recommend the Youtube channel called 'Every Frame A Painting'.
This is from @tonyszhou, a film editor, has very informative tidbits about aspects of acting, directing and editing that will cause you to notice many more details in well made films in the future.
His observations on "A Brief Look at Texting and the Internet in Film" and "The Silence of the Lambs - Who Wins the Scene?" are fascinating.
