Node.js continues to impress me from a variety of perspectives.  I have to admit that one of them is that it is just plain fun (be at both ends of the wire at the same time).  I've been taking a look at StrongLoop (http://strongloop.com/) which is a certified and improved Node.js along with other cool stuff that is where the value really comes from.  StrongLoop includes other components that fully enable the complete software lifecycle dev (quick write stuff!), test (does it work?), ops (is it running?  is it running right?), maint ("yeah, I'm gonna need you to go ahead and come in on Sunday too")  and is better than just running a node script and watching what happens.  If you're into Node you should take a look at StrongLoop.  I expect to be fortunate enough to be posting more on this later.
