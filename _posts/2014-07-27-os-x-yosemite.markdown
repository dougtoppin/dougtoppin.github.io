I'm giving the OS X Yosemite beta (10.10) release a try on my RMBP mid 2012 model.
A number of people had reported a few issues with download speed but I had no trouble with it last night.
From end to end I would guess it took a little over 20 minutes to download and install.
The most obvious difference is the flat looking UI which is fine with me.
I have had no trouble with anything on the MBP so far but got a notice that iTunes 12.0.0.81 was available so I am giving it a try as well.
It looks a little different but no issues either at this point.
Check back for more to come.
