Recently I've had the opportunity to revisit R on a few occasions and am more impressed.  The only caveat being it is probably more than a few minutes to get familiar with it unless you can find a canned script or tutorial that does exactly what you want.  There are a number of books on the subject and I've picked up a few in the last 2 months.  They are:

* Data Mining with R: Learning with Case Studies

* ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (Use R!)

* The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design

* Applied Bayesian Statistics: With R and OpenBUGS Examples

Each of them has pros and cons mostly due to the level of statistical knowledge involved.  I think that the Bayesian book has been beyond my needs and it is a big expensive.  The others are good in different ways.

I will eventually post a few examples of some of what I've been using R for but the main thing is that if you need to do data analysis I recommend giving R a try before you buy something expensive.
