A friend recently recommended the book "Driverless Car Revolution: Buy Mobility, Not Metal”. I’m only partially in it but the author is pointing out that Google and “Big Auto” have completely different approaches to developing driverless cars.
It is very analogous to “The Innovator’s Dilemma” (another excellent read) where someone with an existing product base and history is constrained from innovation where an entirely new enterprise is not.

If you are looking for entertaining reading this is a great one for the Kindle this weekend.
