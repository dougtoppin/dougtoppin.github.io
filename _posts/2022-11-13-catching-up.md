Modern social media and blogging are challenging because of the plethora of platforms and methods for posting.
Between LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, substack, Medium and so many others it is difficult to determine where to blog and on what subjects.

Now with the apparent collapse of twitter, Mastodon has jumped in popularity.
I have used each of these in various forms over the years and, if you happen to notice the gap in time here, I fell off the wagon with this blog.

Hopefully, I can get back on the wagon and post some tidbits.
