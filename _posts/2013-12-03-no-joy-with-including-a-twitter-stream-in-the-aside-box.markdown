From my previous post you might be able to see that I attempted to include a my twitter stream in the aside are on the right.  It actually worked for a couple of refreshes and then, after I did a rake generate it went away (silently).  I don't see any error or problem indication anywhere and I'm getting too tired to mess with it any more tonight.  In general I am not satisfied with my move from a self hosted WordPress site to using Octopress on Github pages.  I've found it too much of a pain, the documentation/instructions are incomplete, including pictures is more difficult, it requires more technical knowledge and I can't post using my iPad/iPhone.  I think that I've given it a fair shot but unless some miracle happens in the very near future I'm going to call it quits with this and explore alternatives.
