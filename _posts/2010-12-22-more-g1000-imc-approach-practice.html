I was in the RedBird FMX sim again last night flying the VOR approach into KMRB.  My instructor had me in IMC all the way down to the 1,020 MDA.  It took me three approaches to make it because on the first two I did not see it at all and on the second I saw it as I was right on top of it.  I improved a little in reaching the MDA pretty quickly and then keeping there.  The one problem that I have had twice now is, on going for the missed approach, fumbling with trying to hit the direct button rather than just pushing the bearing selector to get a course (while in the climb).

For practice at home I have Garmin g1000 simulator (the $26 Windows one) but I have never been able to get that to work.  It hangs every time right after the PFD and MFD come up.
