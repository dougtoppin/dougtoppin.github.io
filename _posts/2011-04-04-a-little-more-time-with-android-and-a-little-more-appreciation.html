I have a Xoom tablet running Android and I have been able to spend some more time with it in the last couple of days.  I am getting a better handle on it now and I see the potential for creativity in the user interface.  The different widgets give more opportunity for a UI that provides the best use and presentation of data.  The iPad still provides a more basic and easy UI but the droid (Honeycomb really) is a bit neater for the tech-savvy user.
