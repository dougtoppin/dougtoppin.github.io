I have been evaluating personal laptops for a while and recently decided on the new MacBook Air (and picked it up yesterday).  My criteria was primarily portability, battery life and capability.  I opted for the 11 inch model, 4gb ram and 256gb disk.  I wanted it to be able to be used for Java development (via Xcode and Eclipse) and have yet to experiment with that.  The Air is intended to augment my desktop iMac rather than replace it but I have the feeling that between my iPad and Air my desktop will languish a bit more.  My experience with OSX Lion so far has been positive.  I have not found the differences to be any sort of issue to adapt to so far
