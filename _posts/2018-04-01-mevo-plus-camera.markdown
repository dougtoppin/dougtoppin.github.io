A couple of years ago I tried the Mevo live streaming camera and had a poor experience with it in regards to reliability and connectivity issues.
I gave up on it and returned it after a couple of weeks of testing.
Late last year the Mevo Plus camera came out and I decided to give it a try.
I have had a totally different experience with the camera and it has been much more reliable and useful.

The camera is a self contained device about half the size of a soft drink can.
It can record to a local SD card or it can stream to a number of services including Facebook and YouTube.

It is controlled via a phone/table app that is extremely useful.
It runs off a 1-hour or so battery or you can add the Mevo Boost, which I also have, to provide a number of hours of power.
The camera has no moving parts and a single 4k image sensor.
The app allows you to control the shot with smooth digital pan and zoom.
Just one of the advantages of this camera is being able to place it in a convenient spot and then remotely control it over a number of hours.

I have no complaints with this camera and recommend it if you are willing to spend the money.

I have a number of technical meetup videos recorded using it on my YouTube channel at [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE-sqJrsswpqkEBl_M2N5Hg?view_as=subscriber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE-sqJrsswpqkEBl_M2N5Hg?view_as=subscriber)
