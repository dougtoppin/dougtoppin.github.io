From a cnn.com story on a deserted giant mall in China, "To me, many of these projects are a result of easy access to capital and a combination of wishful thinking and speculative behavior rather than rational business calculations,".  That describes so many of our problems over the last so many years that it should make you think twice about any software or business estimates that you make.  Are they backed up with some basis in reality or are they want you want to happen?  The story can be found at http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/03/business/china-worlds-largest-mall/index.html?hpt=hp_c2
