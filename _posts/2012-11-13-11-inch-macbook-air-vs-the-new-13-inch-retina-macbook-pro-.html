I've had an 11 inch MacBook Air for over a year and have been happy with it but on occasion it would be nice to have a bit more power.  The MBA is highly portable which is a tremendous benefit.  I took it to the local Apple store recently for a side by side comparison with the new 13 inch Retina MBP.  The MBP does look larger now that I'm used to the MBA and I'm debating the wisdom (and expense) of the upgrade.  The additional space in the MBP gives a longer battery life which would be nice.  I'm running the MBA into the red almost every day and I'm not sure if it could handle an entire day on battery only.
