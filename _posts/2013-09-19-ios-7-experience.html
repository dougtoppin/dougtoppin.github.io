I updated my iPhone and iPad to iOS-7 last night.  Both took a while due to the Apple server download activity but eventually completed.  The very flat UI is noticeably different and takes some getting used to.  My main disappointment so far has been that AirDrop is not supported on the iPad 3 which I was hoping for but it is enabled on my iPhone 5.
