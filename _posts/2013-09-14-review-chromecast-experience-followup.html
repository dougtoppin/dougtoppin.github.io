This is another post regarding my Chromecast experience.  The NOVALUG (Northern Virginia Linux User Group, 20 years in existence next month) has been broadcasting their monthly meetings as Google hangouts and with a live YouTube stream for a little while.  Unfortunately, the Chromecast does not appear to support live youtube streams at this time (http://www.ubergizmo.com/2013/08/chromecast-doesnt-support-youtube-live-streams/) so there is another drawback to it.
