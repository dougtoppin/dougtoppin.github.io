After a couple of month break I decided to start running again today.  I did a 10k at the end of 2010 and then fell off the wagon because of the cold and some snow and it's been hard to start up again.  I have been sticking with my LA Boxing classes all along but I only do that 3 days a week so I need to get back to 2 or 3 days of running as well.  One thing about the boxing classes, we started doing some Plyometrics for the first 15 minutes or so recently and my thighs are killing me. I think that it ends up being one day of Plyometrics followed by one day of cryometrics.
