We lost our previous dog 3 months ago and adopted a 5 month old puppy 2 weeks ago.  I had forgotten how much energy they have and we are regularly chasing her around the house.  We also have to get into a routine of keeping the house organized (no clothes on the floor for example) or else they end up in some other location in some unexpected condition.
