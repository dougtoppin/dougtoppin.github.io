Trying to use Github pages to host an Octopress blog definitely turned into some aggravation when I tried to post to it from another computer.  After numerous Google searches and rm -rf'ing it from my laptop several times I finall ran across this link which fixed my issue: http://weishi.github.io/blog/2013/07/24/setup-an-existing-octopress-repository-after-git-clone/
I have to admit that the instructions for using Octopress/Github pages are not complete from the perspective of using it from more than one computer.  If you are planning on using Github pages and potentially Octopress you might need to expect to spend a little time on both the initial transition and then figuring out each of your workflow paths.  I don't think that it is "bad" but it might not be the simple button push that you expect.
