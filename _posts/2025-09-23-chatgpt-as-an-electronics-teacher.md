Hereâ€™s another interesting experience with ChatGPT (AI).
I am not a hardware person, but many of my old friends are and they would laugh at me for my lack of knowledge of even basic hardware tool experience.

I do a lot of small electronics projects using esp32 and Raspberry Pi boards (which are very small circuit boards and chips).

I decided, well really because a friend has one and I was envious, to get a power supply to make it easier to power and test some of the stuff that I do.
Being a software person I just wanted to poke the buttons to make the lights go, which might lead to a RUD (Rapid Unplanned Disassembly) event.

Instead, I took a picture of it and asked ChatGPT what I should set it to for powering one of my esp32 projects (5v).

It recognized the power supply, knew what the esp32 needed, and then told me how to use it for what I was trying to do. This was in a very instructional fashion as opposed to me finding and reading the documentation for it (bleah).

This is another example of how AI can act as a, very patient, teacher or assistant.
It can provide way more than a simple web search.
