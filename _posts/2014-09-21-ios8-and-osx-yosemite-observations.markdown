### Installation
I have been running the 10.10 beta for OSX Yosemite on my MBP for a while with no significant issues and yesterday installed iOS 8 on both my iPad3 and iPhone5.
The iPhone completed without issue but the iPad was bricked with an apparently forever phase of "verifying update software".
I was forced to restore it from backup and then it updated to 8 without any problem.
It did need to update 138 apps (I have too many apps on it I think but I use it for quite a bit) which took quite a while (more than an hour) but eventually finished.

### Usage
iOS8 on the iPhone has appeared mostly the same to me in appearance and I notice a few new apps (Health, Tips).
So far Health is running without input from any other apps which I think is one of its primary benefits.
I have a FitBit One and scale and it would be very convenient to have the weight and step data collected from them be automatically imported as health data.

I have noticed that my iPad3 seems to flicker a little more in Safari as if it is doing something else at times.
I am not sure exactly when I notice it nor what it might be doing unless it has to do with sync'ing stuff across all of my devices.

More to come on this subject.
