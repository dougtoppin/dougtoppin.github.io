I need to do a little simple statistical analysis (hopefully simple) in the near future and was looking around for the best tool to use.  I am looking at R and Python and thinking that R is the winner at least for now.  I picked up (Kindle version) "The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design" and have been impressed with it and with R.  R is particularly new user friendly in a number of ways including that a variety of data sets are packaged in which can be used for examples and they are just plain interesting to mess with.  I used R a few times years ago and but had forgotten everything about it.  I'm hoping that this experience will stick with me this time.
