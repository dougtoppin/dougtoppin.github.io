I keep thinking about AI and, in particular, the impacts on software jobs. Most recently, enterprise use of AI for software development assistance may be causing a reduction in entry level positions for new graduates. It is assumed/proven that developer use of AI improves efficiency enough to reduce labor needs.

A potential side effect of this may be that entry level jobs builds skills and familiarity with the enterprise which is a layering process. In a sense, this is an internal developer supply chain.

By reducing the entry point of that supply chain, the enterprise may eventually become much more dependent on a maturing labor force.

Of course, it may also be assumed that AI will eventually move beyond entry level functions and take more of the software systems development responsibilities but it does feel like a gap is soon going to appear in that supply chain.

I use both ChatGPT and github copilot and have been very impressed with what they provide as assistants and more. This will only continue to improve but I suspect there are some speed bumps coming.
