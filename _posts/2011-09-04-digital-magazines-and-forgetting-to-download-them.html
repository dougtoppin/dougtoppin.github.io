I have transitioned a number of my magazines (LinuxJournal, The Economist, Aviation Safety, Plane &amp; Pilot) to digital (iPad) or online only editions.  I prefer the digital format because I feel less guilty about the waste of throwing away the printed material combined with the ease of accessibility wherever I am.  One drawback that I am noticing is that with printed magazines I would notice them sitting on a table and it would remind me to read them.  With digital magazines I am noticing that I frequently forget to access/download the magazine.  I am beginning to think that I need to add a reminder in my calendar for when a new edition should be available.  My iPad or Kindle are my preferred reading platforms but now the issue is finding the time to get around to them.
