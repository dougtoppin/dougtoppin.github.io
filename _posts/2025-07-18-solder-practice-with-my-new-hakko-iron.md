title: "Solder Practice with my new Hakko iron"

I felt like improving my soldering game and got a new Hakko FX888DX iron to replace my likely 30 or more year old Radio Shack iron.

I tried it out for the first time today and immediately noticed the improvement. Being able to set a temperature and quickly get to it worked very well. It may also just be an improvement in a different tip.

More to come as I get more experience, but I am happy with it.
