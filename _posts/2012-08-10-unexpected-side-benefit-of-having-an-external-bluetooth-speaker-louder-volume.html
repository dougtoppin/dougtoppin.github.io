I recently bought a Beacon Audio Phoenix external Bluetooth speaker which I have been using for listening to podcasts on my iPhone.  I just had another benefit from it today while listening to a webinar ("Safety Critical Software Development with Rhapsody" by Bruce Douglass at IBM) on my MacBook Air.  I had the volume all the way up but because of a fan in my office I could not hear it very well.  I paired the Beacon with my Air and was able to increase the volume to a much easier to listen to level.  I've been very happy with the Beacon so far and recommend it for value and flexibility.
