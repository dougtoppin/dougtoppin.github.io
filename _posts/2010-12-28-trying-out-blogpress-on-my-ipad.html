I have been using a browser to post to my blog and decided to try using the BlogPress app on my iPad.  One tidbit on it, you have to enable the XML-rpc remote publishing protocol to do this (found in site admin/settings/writing).
The main reason that I am trying this is I am finding that I spend more and more time using my ipad and less on a laptop/computer.
I still do not have the hang of rapid typing on the iPad however so I make many more mistakes.
