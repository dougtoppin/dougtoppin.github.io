ForeFlight continues to amaze me on what is possible using consumer level hardware (the iPad and the iPhone).
The features in their app are astounding.
If you are interested in aviation then watch the video of the new ForeFlight Mobile 7 version and prepare to be impressed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2C4zww9rAY

The planning and situational awareness features are very comprehensive.

The iPad and ForeFlight may not be able to be used as a primary navigation source now but they eventually will be.
