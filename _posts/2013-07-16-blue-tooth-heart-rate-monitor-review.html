I've been pretty satisfied with the iPhone Cyclemeter app because I can put my iPhone on my handlebars and see the map or listen to podcasts while riding.  I've been wanting to capture the ride/walk route and heart rate in a single device so I picked this up last night.  It is the Wahoo BlueHR BlueTooth heart rate monitor and easily paired with my phone.  So far no complaints with it at all (after 2 dog walks). More after my next ride.
