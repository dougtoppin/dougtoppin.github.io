Since updating my iPhone/iPad to iOS7 I've noticed that my cellular data plan was being used up more quickly. Today I noticed the more detailed Settings>Cellular>Use Cellular Data For section that defaulted all of my apps to 'on'. Each entry also includes a note on how much cellular data that they've used. If you're running iOS7 and a paid cell data plan and haven't looked at these settings you might want to take a look. Note if an app is enabled for cellular data I believe that that includes app updates. I should include that how I discovered this was during recent dog walk and when I got home I noticed that I had 3 text messages from AT&T kindly letting me know that I had exceeded my 200mb limit 3 times and the automatic renewal had kicked in.
