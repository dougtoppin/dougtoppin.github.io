I bought a Logitech Revue a couple of weeks ago and it is working out ok so far.  My chief complaint was probably having to use a keyboard with it.  Today I installed the new Google TV iOS app for it and that is a bit better but does take getting used to.  The primary reason for getting the Revue was being able to stream web only sites (such as PPV events).  Our AppleTV is not able to do that so I opted for the Revue.  I would have tried the Boxee device but that was so late in getting to the market I gave up on it.  I saw it in BestBuy recently and may still give it a try but they announced it too far in advance and then took too long to get it out.
