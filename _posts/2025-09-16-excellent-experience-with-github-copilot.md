Did you know that you can use GitHub Copilot to manipulate your non-software-related repositories?
I have been trying out using Copilot to add entries to this blog, and it has been an excellent experience.
It prompts me for the fields and content, and the process is a very natural language experience.
What this demonstrates is that AI can automate various functions beyond software development and testing.
The experience is very much like having a knowledgeable assistant.
