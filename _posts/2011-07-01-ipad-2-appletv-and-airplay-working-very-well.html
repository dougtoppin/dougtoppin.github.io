We have been regularly using the PBS app on my iPad-2 to watch shorts (FutureStates is an excellent set of them) on our TV using AirPlay to our AppleTV.  The setup is working much better than I had expected and I have no complaints at all.  I suspect that projectors will start supporting the AirPlay interface before long.  That is so convenient that having to rely on cables seems very low tech when I have to use my iPad to give a presentation (using KeyNote) at work.
