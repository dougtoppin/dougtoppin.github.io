I've been fortunate for the last week or so to be working on a project where I'm getting to use NodeJS (with Express), MongoDB and the AWS EC2 and S3 which is a lot of fun.  You can work very quickly with Node and I recommend that everyone evaluate using it for real if they can.  The plethora of node modules out there is fascinating.  There always seems to be something that I can use.  I did find that there is a lack of actual/complete examples of using Node with the AWS S3 and I'm hoping to add a few here over the next week.
