I have been trying to chase down a reason for slowdowns that I've been experiencing on my iPad.  When they start happening I fire up XCode on my MBP (still my most favorite computer ever) and take a look at the console log and device logs but I still do not have a handle on it.  I recently ran across the "System Status" iOS app (around $3) which provides pretty good info on what your iOS device is up to.  I still don't know why the slowdowns are happening but I have quite a bit more info.  I recommend it if you are looking for some insight from the iPad itself.
