I was at a MoDevDC (mobile development) meetup last night. One of the members had just launched his new iOS app "airendipity" (free). You can send notes out into the world and people can "catch" and view/comment them. You are able to see the location chain of people that viewed them. It's creative, anonymous and entertaining. I recommend it.
