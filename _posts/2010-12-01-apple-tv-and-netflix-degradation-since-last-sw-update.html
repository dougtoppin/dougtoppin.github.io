We got an Apple TV a few weeks ago and have had no complaints until recently.  It streamed very well and Netflix worked perfectly.  A software update to version 4.1 a couple of weeks ago may have degraded it however.  Movie streaming on it from iTunes does not buffer well and for the first time last night Netflix also buffered poorly.  When I tried to use Netflix on it tonight I could only get "Netflix unavailable" messages.  I switched to Netflix on my iPad and it once again worked perfectly.
A recent survey that I read said that people with iPads are finding that they use them more frequently as time goes by and I am finding the same to be true for me as well.  I am still completely satisfied with my iPad.
