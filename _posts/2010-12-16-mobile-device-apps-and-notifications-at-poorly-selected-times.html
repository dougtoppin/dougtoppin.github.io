I installed the AT&T mobile device app on my iPhone a few days ago. It works well and is convenient.  However, I decided to let it send notifications which turned out to be a bad idea.  This morning, at 4am, AT&T decided to send out notifications that their customer bills were available online.  The result of this rude awakening was me turning off notifications from that app.  I would suggest to mobile app vendors that they consider the use of notifications and only send them at odd hours if it is critical (such as fraud detection on a credit card).  Any non-critical notifications should be queued to be sent from 9am-5pm in the customer timezone or else let the customer configure a notification time window.
