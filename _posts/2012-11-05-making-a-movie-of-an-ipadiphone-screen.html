On several occasions I have needed to make a movie of an iPad or iPhone screen.  I ran across an excellent method for that today.  The OSX/MS Windows app called Reflection (http://www.reflectionapp.com) runs on the computer and presents an AirPlay interface to iOS.  It works very well, is very low priced ($15) and because it is using AirPlay requires no change to the iOS device.  It also has a record to .mov option that produces a very workable movie.  Another side benefit of this is that you can show iPad demos/presentations without having to have an AppleTV if one is not available.
