I am able to type reasonably well using the screen keyboard on my iPad but it tends to be more of a two finger style which is much slower than my usual pace.  I decided to try the Apple wireless keyboard with it (which I am using for this).  My typing speed significantly so I think it is useful for stationary situations where you do not have to carry both around.  If I needed to do a lot of writing I would almost certainly bring it along though.
I am still completely satisfied with my iPad and expect to keep increasing my use of it as time goes on.  I have read more than once that once people have an iPad they tend to find more uses for it over time and the amount that they make use of it continues to increase and my experience agrees.
