I have been trying to find applications that are appropriate for using JBoss Drools and Apache Camel and just saw an announcement by FuseSource (now a part of Red Hat) for an upcoming webinar.  I believe that Camel is a very under-realized application for enhancing legacy systems by integrating in new services/applications with minimal change to the existing software.  The primary reason for it not being used as extensively as it could be is a lack of awareness and familiarity by many software people.  In fact one of my goals for this weekend is to try a very simple Camel implementation that just does a bidirectional translation between XML and JSON.  I will update this when I have some results.
