I recently changed jobs and now am in consulting role involving a number of software technologies including iPaaS.  iPaaS (integration platform as a service) is used to bridge/integrate different systems using a cloud to host at least part of the integration.  I have been extremely impressed with the tooling and approaches available for this and am currently evaluating a couple of them.  I will posting more on this later but it is quite a fascinating area to be involved in and I'm very fortunate to be a part of it.
