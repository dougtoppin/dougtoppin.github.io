I just read about <a href="http://leapmotion.com/">The Leap</a> and am totally impressed with the potential that it has to make augmented reality (AR) a little more natural.   As it is now AR implies that information is being added to what you are seeing either set up in advance (dynamically limiting) or else completely uncommanded which can be overwhelming by loading up what you are seeing.  The Leap, when applied in a mobile device environment, might eventually let you point to something/somewhere to get more (or less) information about your surroundings.   I'm hoping that the desktop version is successful enough to encourage extending it into the mobile environment.  The video shows some of the potential envisioned for using body and object movements as an interface.  I think that the realm of possibility is much greater.
