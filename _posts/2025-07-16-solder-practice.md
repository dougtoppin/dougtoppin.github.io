Today was solder practice. It will hopefully help me get better at my Raspberry Pi and esp32 projects.

I successfully burned myself (twice), got practice with desoldering braid, twisted my arms and hands to weird positions to get the iron to the board, and maybe got a couple right.

Getting there.
