If you like to mess around with data analytics you might like trying out [https://keen.io/](https://keen.io/).
I experimented a little with it using congressional vote data in a little project I made at [https://github.com/dougtoppin/keen-congress-vote](https://github.com/dougtoppin/keen-congress-vote)

I have a couple of applications for this that I am going to experiment with and will post more later.
The applications involve climate type data (simple temperature/humidity values) and collecting them via my Tessel.
