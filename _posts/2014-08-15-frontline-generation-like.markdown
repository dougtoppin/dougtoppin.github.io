If you are interested by all the "liking" that goes on nowadays you should watch the Frontline episode called "Generation Like".
You might think that it is just on what kids are up to nowadays but you would be incorrect.
It is actually about all of the advertising linkages and data collection that is going on.
Before you "like" and reshare stuff you might want to watch it.

One of the interesting (actually strange I think) comments was from a mother in the episode about posting pictures of her daughter who is developing a site/brand for marketing.
"I hate to say it but if I have a full body picture she will get tons of likes".
Does she realize what she is saying and actually doing?
While the vast majority of "likes" and reshares are clearly due to business encouragement that comment seems unusual to me.
