description: Would a PixelBook be able to effectively do development using AWS Cloud9?

I have both personal and work MacBook Pros and my personal MBP is getting long in the tooth (2012).
I've been considering updating it to a newer model but the cost is not trivial and I have to adapt to using USB-C at home.
Instead I've been wondering if a PixelBook would be able to effectively do development and related stuff using AWS Cloud9?

I am still not a pro at Cloud9 but am able to use it and would like to spend more time with it.
I use Spot instances quite a bit now and at $0.02 to $0.06 an hour they are an excellent means of reducing compute related costs.

While I am a dedicated Apple fan I would be willing to try an alternative to the MBP that lets me do what I need to more cheaply and with a longer battery life.

I need to research a bit more on the PixelBook particulary around using a VPN with it.

More to come on this subject.
