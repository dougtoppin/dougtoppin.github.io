I have had a SheevaPlug (little fan less, flash based, Linux plug computer) for over a year and have been very happy with it.  I keep it up 24/7 and it acts a place that I can get to from wherever I am.  I have a MySQL db on it and keep a lot of notes and so on in that.  A few weeks ago it failed and after a little research I discovered that a number of people had had power supply problems with it.  I ordered a replacement ps ($10) from them and got it working again last night.  I had not backed up my db in a year and so would have lost a lot of stuff if I had not been able to get it working again (note to self, actually implement that automatic db export and backup like I meant to get around to).  Since I have been happy with it I ordered the DreamPlug (more capable and supports wifi).  That will even be more convenient.
I installed iSSH and mysql clients on my iPad last night and now am able to use the SheevaPlug from my iPad too.  Works great.
One reason that I had gotten the SheevaPlug was that I felt guilty about wasting power keeping my main desktop Linux machine up 24/7.  The SheevaPlug uses significantly less power.
