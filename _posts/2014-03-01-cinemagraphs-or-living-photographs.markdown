I am always interested in photography and recently learned about Cinemagraphs (sometimes called Living Photographs).
This is where you take a short video that has some movement in it that you want to preserve and a still frame in it that you want the video overlayed upon.
The result is a image that has some movement in it that focuses your attention on a particular element.
The still frame is expanded for the duration that you want, the element that is moving that you are interested in is preserved as a layer and the rest of the video is thrown away.
The result is also significantly smaller data-wise than a full video and very reasonable to embed in a web page. 
I've seen a few cool examples of it and am including some links if you want to take a look see.
