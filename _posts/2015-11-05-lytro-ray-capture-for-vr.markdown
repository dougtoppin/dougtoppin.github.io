The Lytro camera system looks like a neat approach for VR. If I understand it correctly the ray data collected would let you generate a scene, potentially in real time, that matches a changing story line.

This is some neat tech that I would like to know more about.
One aspect is that their leasing/rental plan includes the server.
Something that I've thought about regarding the cloud would be to potentially to use the AWS Snowball (50tb storage transfer unit) to send the data to the AWS and use their vast compute power to more efficiently do the processing.

The video explains some of the Lytro concept and technology.
