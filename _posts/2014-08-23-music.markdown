I am continually fascinated at how music can change or amplify a mood.
There are certainly numerous examples of that but I always find that the band Hammock is exceptionally effective at being able to do exactly that.
This is particularly true with their [Departure Songs](http://hammockmusic.com/) album.

If you listen to *Departure Songs* on a gloomy weather weekend day (like today) it seems to meld perfectly into the mood.

Someday I would like to study how music can affect us this way and I wonder if it is some sort of resonance with brain waves or some other physiological reaction in the parts of your brain tied to hearing.
I would always like to hear from my friends that have made a career out of music and what they think about what makes music so impactful to us.
