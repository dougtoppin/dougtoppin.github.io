I use an Apple Time Capsule as my wireless router and it has worked very well since setting it up a few months ago.  I recently enabled a guest network on it while a friend was visiting and have noticed a distinct reduction in network throughput.  I did a little checking and Apple says that their may be a 20% drop in performance.  It is clear that you should only enable the guest net when you actually need it.
