Since getting my Kindle (and finishing graduate school) I have found that I actually do more reading for pleasure than I used to.  It is very easy to quickly find, buy and start reading when there is something that I am interested in.  However I am also finding that I no longer buy printed books for pleasure reading.  For  example, someone recently recommended "The Last Ship" (post apocalypse nuclear winter) but because it is not available on the Kindle I am not likely to get it.  The Kindle has made it much more likely that I will get something non-technical to read but as a result has restricted my reading to what is available in that format.
