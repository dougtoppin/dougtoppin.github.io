Interesting experience I wanted to pass along regarding extending my wifi network this morning.  The signal from my Apple Time Capsule to my deck was low enough to be sporadic at times.  I plugged in a new Airport Express and expected to have to configure it to extend the network.  Upon detecting the new Airport Express my iPad recommending using it to extend my existing wifi network.  I confirmed that was what I wanted done and it did it.  Nothing else required on my part.  I think that sets the bar higher from my perspective on what I expect consumer electronics to do from now on.
