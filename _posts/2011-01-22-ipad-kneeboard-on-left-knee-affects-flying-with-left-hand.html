I had a G1000 instrument lesson today (kjyo to kokv, RedBird FMX) and this time put my iPad on my left knee with my normal (low tech) kneeboard on the right knee for writing notes and clearances. Having something on my left knee caused my yoke control (using my left hand) to be impacted a little.  I tended to try to brace my left wrist on the tip of the iPad kneeboard which did not work very well. I was using ForeFlight for the approach plate and sectional.  I feel like I need a single kneeboard for holding the iPad and notes and have it on the right knee.  
More to come later.
