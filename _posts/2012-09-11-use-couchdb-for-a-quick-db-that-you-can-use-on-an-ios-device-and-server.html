CouchDB (Mac and iOS) is a pretty good combination.  Using homebrew to install on OSX makes it even quicker to get set up.  If you need a quick db that you can use on your ipad and Mac then CouchDB can do it.  <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installing_on_OSX">http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installing_on_OSX</a>
