We got an Amazon Echo a while back and I recently went to an Amazon Developer Day event to get a little help with using the Echo/Alexa developer services.
I am now able to ask Alexa to read my daily North Korean official motivational phrases to me using an AWS Lambda NodeJS script.

A good example script is provided with the Lambda console and all I had to do was modify that to get Alexa to read a random phrase to me.
You do need to get access to the SDK and developer portal but that did not take long once I requested it.

The Echo is pretty entertaining to mess with and I think that there is a lot of opportunity in voice integration type stuff.
The voice recognition has worked very well in general but it can be hard to break the habit of using a phone or tablet to do something when Alexa could also do it.

Some of the NK phrases can be pretty funny if you have not heard them.
