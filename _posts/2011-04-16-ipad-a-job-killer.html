The news today mentioned that Jesse Jackson Jr called the iPad and Kindle job killers.  This was because of the reduction in demand for books and thus related production and sales jobs.  This is an example of missing the point of new technology.  The iPad and related mobile technology are opportunities for innovative usage where printed media cannot advance any more than it has in many years.  Mobile technology provides basic capabilities that business should be able to find innovative uses for.  All it takes is the thinking part and not being held hostage by the past.  At times I encounter friends that are unaware of some of the capabilities of mobile devices and thus cannot envision what might be useful or helpful to them.  Instead, they limit themselves to the familiar and that is the real job killer.
