One final update on my Mevo cam before it goes back to BB today.
I tried it in the office last Thu and could not connect to it at all.
Today I decided to give it one more chance so I did a hard reset on the cam and deleted the app from my iPhone and reinstalled it.
I start both up and the app says a cam firmware update is required so I think “great, this might fix it!”.
I hit the update button and it spins a bit a says “update failed, unable to connect to Mevo”. Retried numerous times with no progress. #fail
