Since `Childhood’s End` was starting on SyFy I had to read it again.
The book is definitely better than the miniseries which has made several changes that I disagree with.

This is another case where your imagination does a much better job of bringing the story to life than any tv show can.
The description of the bullfight is both believable and agreeable.
I cannot imagine that kind of cruelty being popular.

There are several phrases in the book that are particularly well thought.
One of the best is “The most terrible of all legends had come to life, out of the unknown past."

If you have not read it, or even if you have, you should read it.
