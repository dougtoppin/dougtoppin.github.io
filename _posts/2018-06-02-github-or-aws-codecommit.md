I have paid for a GitHub account for some years with the reason being able to create multiple private repositories.
This gives me the convenience of having a central place for keeping some files that I need to share between several computers.
I never share or collaborate any of my private repos at least so far.

I have been using AWS CodeCommit on a limited basis for some time and have been considering whether or not I should just move my GitHub private repositories to CodeCommit repos and stop paying GitHub.

[CodeCommit pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/codecommit/pricing/) is very likely going to not cost me anything where GitHub is costing me $7 per month.

Using CodeCommit is a little more involved than GitHub but not a decision maker by any comparison.

I would appreciate hearing from anyone that has thoughts, opinions or experiences on this subject.
