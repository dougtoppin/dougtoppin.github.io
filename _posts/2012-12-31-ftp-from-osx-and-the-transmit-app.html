While debugging an issue with this blog today I needed to update a number of the WordPress files.  I initially used ftp (I'm on OSX) but the lack of recursive upload/delete functions made that inconvenient.  I ran across the 'Transmit' app for OSX in the Apple App store and it is working very well.  I have no complaints about it.  It is a GUI based ftp where you have the source dir in one pane and the destination in another and you can drag and drop between them.  It is not free (and not cheap) but sometimes I think it is better to get something that just works when you are time limited.
