Amazon has a series of buttons called 'Dash' buttons that let you easily order stuff.
They also have a version of this button called the IoT (Internet Of Things) Button that you can use to interface with AWS Lambda.
You can then write your own logic on what to do with a button press event.

They recently started selling these buttons but sold out pretty quickly. I would not be surprised if they pop up again so if you like messing with the AWS and IoT type things you should give it a try.

I got a couple and have been fiddling around a bit with them.
I will post more on this later.
