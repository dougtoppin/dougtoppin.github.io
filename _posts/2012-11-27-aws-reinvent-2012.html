I'm at the AWS re:Invent 2012 conference (Amazon services).  I've been looking forward to this for a while because I've seen the opportunity for both cost savings and innovation in cloud architectures.  Today will be a "migrating your applications to the cloud" technical bootcamp topic for me which should be pretty interesting.
