I've previously passed along my opinions on my new(ish) Apple AirPods and have an update from a recent experience with them.

I used them in a somewhat noisier environment for the first time on the subway.
Since they are not noise canceling and do not cover the ear,  outside sound does degrade the experience somewhat.
I found myself increasing the volume a couple of times to hear podcasts better.
Still no real complaints with them but if you are regularly in a noisy environment you may notice it.
