I am getting through the book "The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design" (which I recommend) and just ran across a chapter on using R to access and manipulate images.  It had not occurred to me that images are just matrices and that a tool that inherently supports matrices (like R) can be used on them.  That is a useful tidbit to file away as I have always used ImageMagick at the shell level to act on them.
