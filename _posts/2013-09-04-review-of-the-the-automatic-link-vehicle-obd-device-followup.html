I recently posted something about the Automatic Link vehicle data device that I'm using and wanted to add some followup info.  I am finding that the Link information benefits my driving habits by both showing me the cost of the drive and also by giving me audible alerts on braking/accelerating too quickly as well as driving above 70mph.  There are a couple of places in my commute where all of the above are tempting but knowing that the Link will chastise me if do helps keep me from doing them.  The Link using audible cues so that I don't take my eyes off of the road.

It would be interesting to have the highway department correlate data from a number of Links to look for areas where drivers regularly do similar things.  They might be able to improve traffic efficiency by looking for common factors and adjusting the speed limit or road conditions in that area.
