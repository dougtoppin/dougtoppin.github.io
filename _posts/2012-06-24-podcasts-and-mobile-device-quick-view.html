One thing that I continually find to be a problem is in deciding which of my podcasts to listen to on a mobile device (iPod or iPhone) that has a limited amount of screen space.  Very often the podcast entry title will not contain anything about that specific episode.  The result is that I have to start listening to it to know what it is about.  Having an episode title that contains a least a little about the content would be very helpful.
