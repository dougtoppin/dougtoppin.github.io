Lenticular images are where two images have been combined in strips so that one image is viewed from one angle and the other from another angle.
This can produce a nice effect particularly if the images are related.
One example of that might be a picture of someone at a young age and another picture as an adult.
Years ago I wrote a simple Perl script that takes two images as inputs and creates a third image that is a lenticular combination of both.

If you would like to try my script you can find it at [https://github.com/dougtoppin/lenticular](https://github.com/dougtoppin/lenticular).
It requires a little software knowledge to run it but I am hoping that it is useful to someone.

My intent is to evolve this into a web service to make it easier to try out.
More to come on that.

Wikipedia describes lenticular images at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing).
