The octopress site includes a tutorial to set up a single machine for blogging using github pages but that is not complete if you want to also use another computer.  I ran across this site for exactly that purpose which was helpful:  http://scottcheng.com/blog/2012/11/setting-up-existing-octopress-blog-on-a-new-computer/
This is my first test of using that so hopefully it will work for me.
