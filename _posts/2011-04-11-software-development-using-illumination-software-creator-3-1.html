I am experimenting with using the new Illumination Software Creator 3.1 version to generate some Android code.  I haven't used a code generator like this in a long time but it does save a few steps, time and reduces the familiarity required.  The key thing to know about it is that the tool generates the project and code files and then you import it into Eclipse (or Xcode for iOS) which does the Android build and run.  It does reduce quite a bit of the detailed API knowledge required to do coding which is an advantage (particularly for the beginner in a new environment).  The drawback is probably the additional layering keeps you from doing more of the exotic (but I am not sure of that).  In the case of Android I am particularly interested in the stack widget (like what the CNN app does).
